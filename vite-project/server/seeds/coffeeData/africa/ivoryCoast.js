    coffeeHistory: {
        discovery: "Coffee was introduced to the Ivory Coast by French colonists in the late 19th century. \
        It quickly became a significant crop due to the country's fertile soil and tropical climate. \
        By the early 20th century, the Ivory Coast had established itself as one of the largest coffee producers in Africa, with robusta beans becoming the dominant variety cultivated.",
        development: "The development of coffee in the Ivory Coast focused primarily on robusta beans, which thrive in the region's conditions. \
        Smallholder farmers are the backbone of the industry, harvesting coffee cherries by hand and often processing them using traditional sun-drying methods. \
        Coffee production peaked in the mid-20th century, positioning the Ivory Coast as a major exporter globally.",
