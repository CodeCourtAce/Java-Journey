    coffeeHistory: {
        discovery: "Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, with its discovery dating back as early as 850 CE. \
        Legend tells the story of Kaldi, a goat herder who noticed his goats became energetic after eating red berries from a certain tree. \
        Kaldi tried the berries himself and shared them with monks, who found that the berries helped them stay awake during prayers. \
        This marked the beginning of coffee as both a crop and a cultural tradition.",
        development: "Coffee cultivation began in Ethiopia's forested highlands, where it still grows naturally. \
        Ethiopia's coffee is often referred to as 'heirloom,' as the beans are indigenous varieties that have evolved over centuries in diverse climates. \
        Coffee farming in Ethiopia is a vital part of the economy, with millions of smallholder farmers producing coffee using traditional practices.",
