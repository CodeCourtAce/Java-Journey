    coffeeHistory: {
        discovery: "Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee as long ago as 850 CE. \
        The story goes that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered coffee when he noticed that his goats were more energetic after eating the red berries from a certain tree.\
        He tried the berries himself and felt the same energy. He brought the berries to a local monastery, where the monks disapproved of the berries and threw them into the fire. \
        The aroma of the roasting beans attracted the monks, who raked the beans out of the fire, crushed them, and dissolved them in hot water to create the first cup of coffee.",
        development: "Coffee cultivation began in Ethiopia in the 9th century. \
        Traditional Ethiopian coffee is grown in the forest under the shade of trees. \
        The coffee is harvested by hand, and the beans are sun-dried. \
        Then the beans are grinded and brewed in a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony.",
