        discovery: "Coffee was introduced to Colombia in the early 18th century by Jesuit priests. \
        By the mid-19th century, coffee had become a key export crop, thanks to the country's fertile soil and high-altitude growing regions. \
        Today, coffee is deeply ingrained in Colombian culture and remains one of its most important exports.",

        The National Federation of Coffee Growers, established in 1927, has played a major role in promoting Colombian coffee worldwide."
