        discovery: "Coffee was introduced to Peru in the mid-18th century by Spanish colonists. \
        However, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that coffee became a significant crop, driven by European demand. \
        Today, Peru is recognized as one of the largest coffee producers in South America, particularly known for its organic and fair-trade coffee.",
        development: "Peru’s coffee industry is dominated by smallholder farmers, often cultivating coffee in remote, high-altitude regions. \
        The government and cooperatives have supported efforts to improve quality and promote sustainability, allowing Peruvian coffee to thrive in specialty markets worldwide."
