        discovery: "Coffee was introduced to Brazil in 1727 by Francisco de Melo Palheta, who allegedly smuggled coffee seeds from French Guiana. \
        The tropical climate and fertile soil provided ideal conditions for coffee cultivation, and by the 19th century, Brazil became the world’s largest coffee producer—a title it still holds today.",
        development: "Brazil's coffee industry revolutionized cultivation and harvesting methods, moving from manual to mechanical processes. \
        Its vast plantations, particularly in the southeastern states, produce a wide variety of coffee beans, ranging from commodity-grade to specialty Arabica."
