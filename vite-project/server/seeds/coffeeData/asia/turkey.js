    coffeeHistory: {
        discovery: "Coffee was introduced to Turkey in the 16th century during the Ottoman Empire, likely through Yemen. \
        It quickly became a central part of Turkish culture, with coffee houses ('kahvehane') becoming hubs for socializing, business, and intellectual discussions. \
        By the mid-1500s, coffee had become so integral that laws were enacted allowing a woman to divorce her husband if he failed to provide her with coffee.",
        development: "The Ottoman Empire played a significant role in spreading coffee culture across Europe and the Middle East. \
        Turkish coffee became renowned for its unique preparation method and ritualistic presentation, emphasizing hospitality and community. \
        Even today, it is recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.",

    beanProduction: {
        flavorProfiles: "Turkey imports high-quality Arabica beans, primarily from Yemen and Ethiopia, for its traditional coffee. \

    brewingMethods: {
        traditional: "Turkish coffee is brewed using finely ground coffee beans in a small, long-handled pot called a 'cezve' or 'ibrik.' \
        The coffee is mixed with water and sugar (optional) and simmered over low heat until a frothy layer forms. \
        It is served unfiltered in small cups, allowing the grounds to settle at the bottom.",
        modern: "While traditional methods dominate, modern adaptations include using electric Turkish coffee makers or serving Turkish coffee alongside espresso-based drinks in fusion cafes. \
        Coffee culture in Turkey has also embraced specialty beans and brewing techniques for a global audience.",
