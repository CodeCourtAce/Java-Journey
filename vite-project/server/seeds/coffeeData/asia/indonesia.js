        By the early 18th century, Java coffee had become highly sought after in Europe.",
        development: "Indonesia's coffee industry expanded across its many islands, including Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Bali. \
        Its tropical climate and volcanic soil are ideal for coffee cultivation, leading to a diverse range of flavor profiles. \
        The country is known for producing both Arabica and Robusta coffee, with a focus on traditional processing methods like wet-hulling ('Giling Basah').",
