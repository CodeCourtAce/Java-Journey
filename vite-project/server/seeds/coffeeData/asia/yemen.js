        discovery: "Yemen is considered one of the earliest countries to cultivate coffee, with records dating back to the 15th century. \
        Yemeni Sufi monks are credited with popularizing coffee as a beverage, using it to stay awake during long religious rituals. \
        Coffee cultivation and trade flourished in the port city of Mocha, which became synonymous with high-quality coffee and gave its name to the coffee drink 'mocha.'",
        development: "Coffee cultivation in Yemen relies on traditional methods, with coffee grown on terraced hillsides in high-altitude regions. \
        Yemeni farmers use ancient practices to dry-process coffee cherries, imparting a unique, complex flavor to the beans. \
        Yemen's role in the coffee trade helped spread coffee culture across the Middle East, Europe, and beyond.",
